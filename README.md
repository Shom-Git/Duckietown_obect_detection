3. Copy a ROS Package

       $ git clone https://github.com/ldw200012/duckietown_object_recognition.git

4. Run below commands to configure your ROS Package

       $ cd ~/catkin_ws
       $ catkin_make
       $ source devel/setup.bash (This command must be run on every shell you are using for ROS from now on)
